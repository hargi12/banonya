Below is some feedback for us;

1.  On the first page, I am thinking that we may need a few more details from our participants which i think can be more useful in the future. These are details of gender, contact no., fname, age of person answering and location.

2. Could we think of a small menu listing all domains that will constitute the questions, then design it in a simple manner that allows the participant to pick or start answering frem any domain and then link him or her to the rest of the other pages containing other domains.

3. I propose that at the end of every qn, we first put alternative answers of YES or NO.

Then we can only display the rating scale to people who answer Yes for a particular characteristic and hide the rating scale from all those that say NO to that question.

4. I would also desire that we give a slight description probably at the introductory statement of what the rating scale means i.e. 1- worst and 4-is best.

5. Kindly don't forget to include and alternate the domain page colors.

6. I also cannot wait to see how results will  display.
